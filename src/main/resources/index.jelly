<div>
  This plugin makes it possible to integrate data from <a href="http://www.appdynamics.com">AppDynamics</a> into your Jenkins build.<br/>
  A performance test should be run during build time (e.g. by using <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/jmeter/">JMeter</a>),
  and having AppDynamics connected to your application. After the build, the
  performance statistics will be fetched from the REST uri and shown in the Jenkins interface.
